# Frontend (Vite + ReactJS)

### Layout

The layout is similar to [Youtube Music](https://music.youtube.com)
The frontend will not feature any routing so it's going to be a single page application.

There will be the album art, displayed big on the left side and the list of songs on the album with the artists' name right below.
The bottom of the screen will have the player controls and the current status of the song playing.
